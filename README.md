# Version Control Simulation

## Project Reflection

* The steps you took to create and manage branches.
   * I have created a review/main branch from the main branch when I had an empty index.html file as the initial commit after initializing the local repo and connecting it to the remote repo and pushing it to the remote repo. After that, I went ahead and created the following two branches from the review/main branch: feature/header and feature/footer. And once I was done working on the two feature branches, I merged them into the review/main branch so I could push the review/main branch to github before creating the pull request in order to merge the review/main branch into the main branch on github. 
 * How you handled the merge conflict.
   * I handled the merge conflict by accepting both changes from the feature/footer branch and the feature/header branch. Once I did that, I added the resolved conflict index.html to the staging area before commiting it to github to mark the merge as complete by git. 
 * How the pull request process helped you ensure code quality and collaboration.
   * The pull request process helped me ensure code quality and collaboration by allowing code reviews to ensure quality and identify issues. It also helped with collaboration by making it easy to track, comment on, and test changes. Lastly, it helped avoid errors by ensuring that changes are merged into the main project only after being reviewed and approved.
